| TIP-169 | Thales state log | Draft | @electric | Deploy Thales state log | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-09-01

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to create Thales State Log (TSL).
The Thales State Log is a living document which defines the state of Thales protocol. Amendments and additions to the TSL can be made via a Thales Improvement Proposal (TIP).

## Motivation
State of the protocol is currently available in the form of passed TIPs. It is difficult to find specific information in this format. This TIP proposes to create one easy to read living document where all the current information from TIPs will be stored. All future TIPs will result in modifications to the existing Thales state log.

## Specification
Create the Thales state log by extracting all important and up to date information from passed TIPs. 
Moving forward, all future TIPs must explicitly specify the part of the state log that will undergo modification.
