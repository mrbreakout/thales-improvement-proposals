| TIP-218 | Reinstate Buyback and Burn, Remove Inflationary and USDC Rewards | Draft | degeneratoor | Modify THALES tokenomics to reinstate buyback and burn while removing all rewards | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-07-04

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to reinstate the buyback and burn program while simultaneously stopping all inflationary THALES rewards and USDC rewards from fees.

## Abstract
The proposal aims to modify THALES tokenomics by bringing back the buyback and burn mechanism, which was previously paused. Additionally, it seeks to halt all inflationary THALES rewards and discontinue USDC rewards distributed from fees. This change is intended to shift the tokenomics model towards a potentially deflationary system, focusing on token value through reduced supply rather than direct rewards.

## Motivation
The current ecosystem dynamics present an opportunity to optimize THALES tokenomics. By reinstating buyback and burn while adjusting the reward structure, we aim to:

Enhance the token value proposition through strategic supply management
Align token value more closely with protocol performance and usage
Simplify the tokenomics model for better long-term sustainability
Adapt to evolving market dynamics and user preferences
The current environment and protocol state support a buyback and burn mechanism:

The protocol's maturity and stable fee generation provide a consistent source for buybacks
A buyback and burn approach can potentially provide more value to long-term token holders in the current market context
This proposal seeks to balance the interests of long-term holders, active users, and the overall health of the Thales ecosystem, while positioning THALES for future growth.

## Specification
The proposed changes are as follows:

Reinstate the buyback and burn program:
Reactivate the previously paused buyback and burn contract
Set the buyback frequency and amount (e.g., $X per day, to be determined based on current treasury and fee income)

Stop all inflationary THALES rewards:
Halt the minting and distribution of new THALES tokens for staking or any other reward programs

Discontinue USDC rewards:
Stop the distribution of USDC rewards that were being allocated from protocol fees

Adjust the SafeBox fee allocation:
Direct all SafeBox fees towards the buyback and burn program

## Variables
- Buyback frequency and amount (to be determined)
- Effective date for the cessation of rewards and reinstatement of buyback and burn

## Implementation
1. Update smart contracts to cease THALES and USDC reward distributions
2. Reactivate and potentially update the buyback and burn contract
3. Modify fee distribution to direct SafeBox fees to the buyback and burn program
4. Update frontend interfaces to reflect the removal of rewards and reinstatement of buyback and burn
