| TIP-212 | Introduce a Cooldown Period for THALES/WETH LP Staking| Draft | stake_stake |Introduce a Cooldown Period for THALES/WETH LP Staking | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-05-20


## Simple Summary

Introduce a 20 day cooldown period for unstaking THALES/WETH LP positions.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes a cooldown period, similar to that which is present in THALES staking. We propose a period of 20 days, but durations of 30, 60, and 90 days should also be considered.  

## Motivation  

Currently, Thales staking utilizes a cooldown period to help promote long-term commitment from Thales stakers. Extending this to THALES/WETH LP staking aims to encourage stickier liquidity.  

## Specification 

Determine a new cooldown period of at least 20 days for unstaking THALES/WETH LP positions. 

The current THALES/WETH LP staking contract will need to be upgraded to introduce an cooldown period. 

After the upgrade, a user will need to initiate and then wait for the cooldown period to end before withdrawing their LP position.

## Implementation

To be discussed with engineers upon approval
