| TIP-221 | Change referral rewards | Draft | holmberg & BigPenny| Make referrals invite only | discordlink | 2024-08-06

## Simple Summary
Change the referral reward system to invite only exclusively for integration partners. 

## Motivation
The majority of referrals are obvious self-referrals. The anticipated positive effect of organic user growth through open refferals has not been achived. Since every refferal is diminishing the protocols profits, investments should be focused on such referals that actually benefit the protocol. Integration partners have proven to be reliable drivers of volume, generating actual organic volume through true referrals thus only such integration partners should be allowed to participate in our referral program.

## Specification
The "Normie Tier" from TIP-166 gets depricated. All existing Normie Tier referrals will be voided, the contract function will be disabled and the frontend will be remved. The existing Silver and Gold Tiers from TIP-166 will remain unchanged.
