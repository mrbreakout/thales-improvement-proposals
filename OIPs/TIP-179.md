| TIP-179 | xThales incentives | Draft | fhd | only emit locked thales for LP incentives |  | 2023-11-06
 
## Simple Summary
 Introduce a new token contract, xThales. These tokens will be distributed in place of Thales incentives for providing liquidity. Every other incentive will remain as regular Thales
 

## Specification 
 - Lock Y Thales for Z weeks in the contract, and it will mint Y xThales tokens.
 - These tokens will be unlockable after Z weeks
 - xThales can be unlocked for Thales at any time:
 - within `0.5Z weeks`, : 75% burned, 25% unlocked
 - within `Z weeks`: 25% burned, 75% unlocked
 - after `Z week`s: 100% unlocked

every week, thales incentives will be increasingly locked for an extra week from the range 1...52 weeks

- next week, incentives will be locked for 1 week
- week after that, incentives locked for 2 weeks
- this will increase until 52 weeks

## Motivation
Currently, liquid emissions favor farmers. Introducing xThales as incentives would decrease farming by mercenaries and consequently increase farming by people who believe in the Thales protocol. This would also decrease the inflation of Thales, as there should be at least some people unlocking xThales early.
