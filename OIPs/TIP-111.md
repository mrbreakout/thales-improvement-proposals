| TIP-111 | Reduce the duration of Thales Council term | Implemented | padzank (@padzank) | Reduce Thales Council term to last 4 months instead of 6 months  | https://discord.gg/thales | 2022-12-01
 
## Simple Summary
 
This meta-governance TIP proposes to **reduce Thales Council term** from the original 6 months duration **to 4 months**.
 
## Abstract
 
For the previous three Thales Council epochs, the duration of the term of each elected council member was 6 months.  
 
This TIP proposes to reduce the Thales Council term to 4 months for all of the subsequent epochs, starting with Epoch 4.
 
## Motivation
 
When Thales protocol launched, it was important to not have significant friction in decision making to not slow the rapid iteration process of the protocol while also maintaining a sufficient level of community ownership.  
As the protocol matures and with significantly larger product offerings across the Thales protocol, community engagement in governance should also increase. Decreasing the epoch to 4 months should increase Council members' motivation, combat stagnation and organically increase the communities inclusion in Thales governance structure.  
 
## Specification
 
This proposal entails the Thales Core Contributors to facilitate a new Thales Council election process every 4 months, counting from the time of previous election end.
