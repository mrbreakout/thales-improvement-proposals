| TIP-119 | Integrate XAU and XAG as available assets on Thales Marketplace | Vote Pending | padzank (@padzank)| Add XAU (Gold) and XAG (Silver) price feeds from Chainlink to Thales on all supported networks with XAU and XAG feeds and enable market creation around those assets' price feeds. | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-12-26
 
## Simple Summary
 
Add XAU/USD and XAG/USD price feeds from Chainlink to Thales and enable market creation around those assets price feeds on all supported markets.
 
## Abstract
 
To diversify Thales Marketplace offering from exclusively crypto assets, this TIP proposes to integrate **XAU** and **XAG** price feeds into PriceFeed.sol contract and thus enables market creation around those assets on the Thales marketplace. This TIP additionally proposes to enable a "market close" mechanism for XAU and XAG markets to be synchronised with global XAU and XAG market close times.
 
## Motivation
 
Main motivation around adding XAU and XAG as supported assets to trade around, is to diversify the offering on Thales to commodities. The necessary implied volatility needed for trading will be pulled from barchart.com VOLATILITY & GREEKS page relevant to Gold and Silver assets.
 
## Specification
 
This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to integrate the following Chainlink data feeds into Thales smart contracts across all supported networks and this way enable creation of markets around these assets:
 
 - XAU/USD  (Optimism Proxy: [0x8F7bFb42Bf7421c2b34AAD619be4654bFa7B3B8B](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8F7bFb42Bf7421c2b34AAD619be4654bFa7B3B8B))
 - XAU/USD  (Arbitrum Proxy: [0x1f954dc24a49708c26e0c1777f16750b5c6d5a2c](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1f954dc24a49708c26e0c1777f16750b5c6d5a2c))
 - XAU/USD  (BNB Chain Proxy: [0x86896feb19d8a607c3b11f2af50a0f239bd71cd0](https://bscscan.com/address/0x86896feb19d8a607c3b11f2af50a0f239bd71cd0))
 - XAU/USD  (Polygon Proxy: [0x0c466540b2ee1a31b441671eac0ca886e051e410](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0c466540b2ee1a31b441671eac0ca886e051e410))  
   
 - XAG/USD  (Optimism Proxy: [0x290dd71254874f0d4356443607cb8234958dee49](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x290dd71254874f0d4356443607cb8234958dee49))
 - XAG/USD  (BNB Chain Proxy: [0x817326922c909b16944817c207562b25c4df16ad](https://bscscan.com/address/0x817326922c909b16944817c207562b25c4df16ad))
 - XAG/USD  (Arbitrum Proxy: [0xc56765f04b248394cf1619d20db8082edbfa75b1](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc56765f04b248394cf1619d20db8082edbfa75b1))
 
This TIP additionally entails Thales Protocol DAO to implement a solution for non-perpetual open trading hours of XAU and XAG by implementing a mechanism where the AMM cuts off liquidity to XAU and XAG markets when the Chainlink price feed reports the price to be `0` during market close.
