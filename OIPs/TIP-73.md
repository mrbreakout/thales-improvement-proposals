| TIP-73 | Overtime update threshold | Draft | Svenska (@svenskafr) | This TIP proposes to update Overtime threshold | https://discord.gg/qHjr5aF7 | 2022-07-31
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to update threshold from 10-90 to 5-95 on Overtime in order to increase positionable markets.
 
 ## Motivation

After the initial soft launch of Overtime with MLS & MLB, we have now two more soccer leagues (EPL and Ligue 1) and [many more](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-60.md#market-creation) to come.

In leagues where there is a huge level gap between top/bottom teams (eg: Bayern Munich in Bundesliga or PSG in Ligue 1), odds can be very low/high and with a 10-90 theresold, we are not able to offer positions for each option:
- HOME
- AWAY
- DRAW
    
This is a drawback because it has several downsides:
- We don't allow users to position on some options and then leave money on the table (fees and capturing losing positions)
- We are not competitive with traditional bookies who always offer these 3 positions for every market
