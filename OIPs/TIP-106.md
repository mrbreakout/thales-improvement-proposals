This TIP proposes to increase buyback frequency

## Abstract

Increase buyback frequency

## Motivation

Having closely watched our SafeBox fees frequency last few weeks and considering the spike in Overtime volume with the parlays release and World Cup campaing, I am comfortable we can increase our buyback daily rate from $1200 to $1500 while still maintaining the unwritten rule that I cling to which is 100 days of buybacks runway ensured.
