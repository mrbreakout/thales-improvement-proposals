| TIP-150 | Add JsonOdds (golf) as a data provider to Overtime| Draft |  (@coathales) | Add New JsonOdds node to support new Sports on Overtime|  | 2023-06-27

## Simple Summary
This tip entitles Thales protocol to leverage a new [JsonOdds](https://jsonodds.com/) Chainlink node to Overtime and support new sports, notably golf.

## Motivation
Golf has been in high demand from Overtime users. As one of the most popular global sport with very high price pools, it is one of the most liquid sports on web2 sportbooks.  
Unfortunately, golf is not currently supported by Overtime's existing data providers, but we believe we have found a good match with JsonOdds, and after rounds of talks and internal testing, we recommend adding their data via Chainlink nodes to Overtime.    

## Specification
JsonOdds provides schedule, odds and results for all PGA tournaments. They offer various market types on golf, but we propose to start with "Tournament winner" market type, and eventually h2h tournament score markets, before adding markets such as specific round winners.  

This addition does not require contract code changes on our end, just enabling Golf via SportID. Everything else is handled on the node adapter side to make sure the data fits into the formats Overtime expects. The changes would be adding the new node address, new supported sport IDs and caps per sport, which will start low and grow iteratively as we gain more confidence with the new data.

This TIP entitles Protocol DAO to utilize other available market types and sports from JsonOdds if there is community interest for those and protocol DAO finds those safe to add.
