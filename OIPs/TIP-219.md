| TIP-219 | LP incentives renewal | Draft | Svenska (@0xsvenska) | Renewal of LP incentives program  | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-07-07


## Simple Summary

Renewal of incentives and bribes across existing incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes the renewal of current AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incentivized LPs.

Current structure to be renewed:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `10,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `0`
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `5,000` THALES per week
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `2,000` THALES per week
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : `2,500 THALES` per week

These emissions are to run for `8 weeks` until further revaluation.
  
## Motivation
 
The aim of the latest TIPs was to adjust incentives in order to achieve an efficient ratio between available liquidity and required amount of incentives to provide.

In view of the current APRs on THALES' liquidity pairs, it seems that there is no point in reducing them further at this stage, at the risk of seeing current liquidity decline.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `10,000` THALES per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `0`
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `5,000` THALES per week
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `2,000` THALES per week
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : `2,500` THALES per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
