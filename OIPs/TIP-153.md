| TIP-153 |Remove SB fee and burn | Draft | fhd |Remove SB fee and redirect to LP's |  | 2022-07-10
 
## Simple Summary
 On Overtime, for referred users, `0.5%` trade fee goes to the referrer as usual, and the other `0.5%` goes directly to the AMM LP's. 
 For non-referred users, the entire SB fee goes directly to the AMM LP's. 

 Do the same for Parlay AMM and Thales AMM.

Stop the daily burning of thales, and keep the current SB fees for future emergencies
## Motivation

Burning only benefits Thales/ETH and Thales/USDC LP's on Optimism. It may boost morale seeing price hold a little bit but really only benefits short term traders. The benefits of burning are only realized when Thales is sold, which is the opposite of what we want. Redirecting fees directly to the AMM would: increase APR, and thus encourage long term stakers to join.

Looking at Dune, it seems that this TIP would increase APR's by `1.2` to `1.5x`. The earning power of each Thales will increase. Current rounds resulting in `1%` weekly ROI would be returning `1.2%` to `1.5%` instead.
