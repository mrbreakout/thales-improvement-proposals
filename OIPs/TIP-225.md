| TIP-225 | LP incentives renewal | Draft | Holmberg | Renewal of LP incentives program  | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-09-04


## Simple Summary

Renewal of incentives and bribes across existing incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes the renewal of current AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incentivized LPs.

- Current structure to be renewed:  
- ptimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 8,000 THALES per week (down 2K Thales from prior)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week (keep same)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 1,500  THALES per week (down 500 thales from prior)
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : 1,500 THALES per week (down 1000 thales from prior)

These emissions are to run for `8 weeks` until further revaluation.
  
## Motivation
 
The aim of the latest TIPs was to adjust incentives in order to achieve an efficient ratio between available liquidity and required amount of incentives to provide.

In view of the current APRs on THALES' liquidity pairs, it seems that there is no point in reducing them further at this stage, at the risk of seeing current liquidity decline.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
- Current structure to be renewed:  
- ptimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 8,000 THALES per week (down 2K Thales from prior)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week (keep same)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 1,500  THALES per week (down 500 thales from prior)
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : 1,500 THALES per week (down 1000 thales from prior)

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
