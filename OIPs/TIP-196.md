| TIP-196 | Participate in Blast Big Bang Competition | Draft | Jayref | Launch SpeedMarkets on Blast | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-01-25 |


## Simple Summary



This TIP proposes for Thales SpeedMarkets to participate in the ‘Blast Big Bang Competition’ for a one-off opportunity to promote Thales’ products to a wide audience with incentives and promotion sponsored by Blast.

Applications to partake in the competition run from 17/01-17/02 2024.

This TIP calls for the deployment of SpeedMarkets contracts (regular and chained) on Blast testnet to participate in the competition. SpeedMarkets are chosen due to their relatively simple deployment. The decision on whether to deploy on Blast mainnet may be affected by competition outcome, and will be made at the discretion of Thales Protocol DAO.




## Abstract


This TIP proposes for Thales to apply to Blast's Big Bang Competition with SpeedMarketsAMM contracts for the purpose of growing awareness, usage, and volume of Thales’ products by leveraging Blast’s momentum and impending grants to dApps.


## Motivation



Blast has 110k+ users (address with deposits), totaling $1.3bn+ in TVL. Half of Blast’s airdrop will be given to developers, incl. the dApps that win the ‘Big Bang Competition’. 

There is ample data that grants/incentives drive usage of Thales’ products (as evident from OP and ARB rewards), so a similar outcome should be expected on Blast. Blast’s co-marketing of dApps is an added benefit.

As an Ethereum Layer2 network, it is expected that the work needed to deploy contracts will be fairly lightweight. 
Pyth oracles will be present on Blast right from the start, which should further facilitate simple deployment.
For winners of the competition, Blast will offer office hours with core contributors, tech leads, investors and designers to help facilitate an effective launch.



## Specification


This TIP entails that the Thales Protocol DAO applies to participate in the Blast Big Bang Competition to launch SpeedMarkets on Blast. 
While this TIP only covers SpeedMarket contracts (regular and chained) explicitly, other products may also be launched on Blast at the discretion of Thales Protocol DAO. 
Competition outcome may affect the decision to subsequently launch Thales products on Blast mainnet and will be determined at the discretion of Thales Protocol DAO.

The tokens available to take positions on in SpeedMarkets are left to Thales Protocol DAO’s discretion, though popularly traded assets (e.g. ETH and BTC) are expected, along with assets that are prominent on Blast (incl. Blast’s token).

The application process is to be managed by Thales Protocol DAO, which includes providing a 3-minute product video and stating which product category the application falls under (e.g. GambleFi).
