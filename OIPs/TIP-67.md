| TIP-67 | Velodrome bribes program | Implemented | Danijel (@danijelthales) | This TIP proposes a 10 weeks velodrome bribes program with 50k THALES total amount | https://discord.gg/8bzFdpGTrp | 2022-07-10
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to commence a 10 weeks program for bribing THALES-USDC velodrome pool
 
 ## Motivation
 
Velodrome has been hard at work since their launch and it seems en route to establish itself as the dominant DEX protocol on optimism per TVL and volume.  
Optimism has clearly expressed their support to Velodrome by allocating them 3,000,000 OP tokens from partners fund.  
This TIP aims to establish a bigger THALES presence on Velodrome with a relatively trivial weekly bribe, as advised by Velodrome team.  
The program is to be evaluated after 10 weeks.    

Thales will still support G-UNI LP staking rewards as voted in [TIP-55](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-55.md)

## Specification

Setup 5,000 THALES weekly Velodrome bribes for 10 weeks for THALES-USDC [pool](https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity).
