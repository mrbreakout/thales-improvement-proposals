## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to increase buyback frequency

## Abstract

Increase buyback frequency

## Motivation

Referring  '**TIP-59: Increase Thales Token Buybacks**'  
Thales protocol increased buyback frequency from 24h to 18h which increased daily buyback amount from 300 sUSD to 400 sUSD.
TIP-59 implemented more than a month ago and since then safebox amount kept increasig amidst of buybacks.

Recently 40k sUSD profits transfered from Thales Market AMM to safebox and currently it is safe to support 200 days of buyback without adding additional funds.

Moreover, Thales Protocol added a new dapp called Overtime for which sportsAMM pays %2 of each transaction to safebox.

As a summary, referring above findings and considering current value of Thales Token it is good time to increase buyback frequency and good opportunity to
accumulate more Tokens for good price.

## Specification

Update variable `sTickLength` from "18h" to "12h"
