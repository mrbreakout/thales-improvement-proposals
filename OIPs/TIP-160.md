| TIP-160 | Update Gamified Staking configuration | Implemented | @Gorstak | Reduce maxStakingMultiplier to 3x and LP multiplier to 0.25x | [discordlink](https://discord.com/channels/906484044915687464/1096560138757873694/1137402303167598652) | 2023-08-07

## Simple Summary
After two weeks of new staking mechanics in place the conclusion was that LP volume is heavily correlated with amount of $THALES staked,
therefore we propose to reduce the amount of $THALES needed for maxStakingMultiplier and also reduce the LP multiplier.

## Abstract
This TIP proposes changes to TIP-135(https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-135.md) to reduce the weight given to staked $THALES and depositing into LP

## Motivation
Distribution for gamified staking bonus are heavily in favor of large $THALES stakers who are also providing liquidity for Thales AMM and Overtime. 
The amount of $THALES staked is giving allowance for LP, so whales will get an upperhand with current system in place as big LP providers have to be also a big staker. 
We want to give traders and active users of protocol a fair opportunity to compete for the rewards.

## Variables
maxStakingMultiplier = ~~5x~~ -> 3x 
tradingMultiplier = 1x 
lpMultiplier = ~~0.5x~~ -> 0.25x
vaultMultiplier = 0.25x

## Implementation
TBD
