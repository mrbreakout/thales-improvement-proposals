| TIP-173 | Add shorter timeframes and dynamic fees to SpeedAMM | Implemented | Danijel | Add shorter timeframes and dynamic fees to SpeedAMM |  | 2023-10-02
 
## Simple Summary
Add shorter timeframes and dynamic fees to SpeedAMM.

## Motivation

SpeedMarkets saw massive early success with over 350k in Volume in the first month of running, over 250 unique users and 4000 markets created, with a positive PnL all along.  

We feel comfortable dabbing into shorter timeframes, but it is clear that we need a more adaptive fee structure to do so.  

## Specification
 
The shortest timeframe would be 15 minutes. 

The proposed fee strucutre would work like this with regards to the timeframe:  

* 15 minutes to 30 minutes markets = 15% fee
* 30 minutes to 1 hour markets = 10% fee
* 1 hour markets to 2 hour markets = 6% fee
* more than 2 hours: 5% fee  

The fee above is the LP fee. The additional Safe Box fee is 2%. 

As this product is still in Beta and we likely expect a need to further adapt and change as we observe behaviours, pDAO shall remain the right to change these parameters without additional TIPs.
