| TIP-234 | Raise WETH and THALES performance fee for LPs on Overtime | Draft | Padzank (@padzank) | Raise WETH and THALES performance fee for LPs on Overtime | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-10-29

## Simple Summary

Raise LP performance fee **for WETH and THALES pools** from 20% to **30%**.

## Abstract

To follow up with the USDC performance fee increase, this TIP proposes to also increase WETH and THALES LP performance fees to 30%. The increased performance fee from WETH will continue going to stakers distribution and increased THALES performance fee will increase the burned amount of THALES from said fees by 50%.

## Motivation

Increase in WETH utilization, volume numbers and positive PNL entails an increase to 30% performance fee as well for that pool.  

If we increase THALES pool performance fee to 30%, it effectively means we increase the burn from that function by 50%. Since the THALES pool has no external LPs other than the treasury, there is no effect to the LP community.

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to increase the LP Performance Fee variable from 20% to **30%** for **WETH LP pool** and **THALES LP pool** on Overtime.

## Implementation

TBD
