| TIP-117 | Increase limits for Parlays| Draft | Danijel (@danthales) | Increase maxSupportedOdds and parlaySize caps | https://discord.gg/thales | 2022-12-17
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP entails pDAO to raise the caps on Parlays starting from 1st of January.
 
## Motivation

With Parlays being live for a bit more than a month, we can say with high conviction that the product has been a huge success.  
It generated more than a million in notional volume, while securing a positive PnL of 13k.  More detailed data is available [here](https://dune.com/leifu/parlay-market-dashboard).  

Based on this performance, I feel confident to propose an increase in the maximum number of games that can be placed on a single Parlay as well as the maximum quote.  

The proposed changes are to take effect from 1st of January with the start of a new Parlay competition round. 
    
## Specification
Increase parlaySize from 4 to 6 allowing a maximum of 6 positions to go on a single ticket.  
Increase maximum quote a parlay can have to enable potential wins up to 30x (0.033 implied odds). 

This TIP also enables pDAO to continue scaling Parlays without the necessity of an additional TIP should pDAO be confident about new increases up to 10 games and 100x.

I am also proposing to drop the minimum deposit for a Parlay to 5 sUSD.

With the increase to 6 maximum positions, we have to change how the `riskPerCombination` logic works. Instead of looking only at unique combination of positions, we will only consider the unique combination of games. As this can capture same games but with different positions on Parlays, the riskPerCombination cap is to be raised to 15k from 5k.  

I am also proposing to raise max net winning of a single Parlay to 10k from current 5k.
