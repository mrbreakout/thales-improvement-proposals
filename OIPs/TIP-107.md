| TIP-107 | Increase ThalesAMM Positional Token price limits | Draft | padzank (@padzank) | Increase price limits of Positional Tokens from 0.1<>0.9 to 0.08<>0.95 | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-11-21
 
## Simple Summary
 
Increase ThalesAMM price limits of Positional Tokens from `0.1<>0.9` to `0.08<>0.95`.
 
## Abstract
 
**This TIP proposes that ThalesAMM moves `minSupportedPrice` and `maxSupportedPrice` from `0.1` and `0.9` to `0.08` and `0.95` respectively.**
 
## Motivation
 
Increasing the liquidity price limits to 0.08 and 0.95 should increase UX and drive more volume while not increasing the AMM risk. Market liquidity will be more resilient towards asset price swings and traders will have more versatility. Allowing purchase of options up to 95% of implied probability means that users will be able to purchase even safer positions but also subsequently drive more volume to the platform. The AMM risk parameters remain the same and ITM position buyers will incur the same risk to the AMM as before but with more volume and fees driven to the SafeBox contract.
 
## Specification
 
This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to implement to increase the `minSupportedPrice` to `0.08` and `maxSupportedPrice` to `0.95` in the (ThalesAMM.sol)[https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5ae7454827D83526261F3871C1029792644Ef1B1] contract across all supported networks.
 
## Variables
 
`minSupportedPrice` = `80000000000000000`  
  
`maxSupportedPrice` = `950000000000000000`
