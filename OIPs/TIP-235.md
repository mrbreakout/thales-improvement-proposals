| TIP-235 | LP incentives renewal | Draft | BigPenny | Renewal of LP incentives program  | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-1-02


## Simple Summary

Renewal of incentives and bribes across existing incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes the renewal of current AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incentivized LPs.

- Current structure to be renewed:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 6,000 THALES per week (2k down from prior)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week (unchanged)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 1,500  THALES per week (unchanged)
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : 1,500 THALES per week (unchanged)

These emissions are to run without additional approvals needed until overwritten by a new TIP changing AMM incentives.
  
## Motivation
 
The aim of the latest TIPs was to adjust incentives in order to achieve an efficient ratio between available liquidity and required amount of incentives to provide.

An important addition of this TIP is the infinite runtime of the incentives until the TIP gets overwritten by a new one.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 6,000 THALES per week (2k down from prior)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week (unchanged)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 1,500  THALES per week (unchanged)
- Arbitrum Ramses new THALES/WETH pool incentives : 1,500 THALES per week (unchanged)

These emissions are to run without additional approvals needed until overwritten by a new TIP changing AMM incentives.
