| TIP-108 | Reduce min_spread variable for Vaults| Draft | Danijel | Reduce min_spread fee when Vaults are buying from the AMMs  | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-11-25


## Abstract

This TIP proposes to reduce min_spread fee to 0.5% when Vaults are buying from Thales or Overtime AMMs.
 
## Motivation
 
The reasoning is much the same as in [TIP-105](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-105.md) which is that vaults are purely beneficial to the protocol as they balance the AMM exposure and for them to have the best change to be profitable long term and attract liquidity they need sufficient discounts which will be much easier to achieve if the min_spread variable is set to minimum when Vaults are buying from the AMM. 
## Specification 

- Add a configurable mapping to our AMM contract that allows to set a dedicated min_spread fee for a specific address
- Reduce min_spread fees for Vaults when buying from AMMs 0.5% (it's 2% for Thales AMM right now and 1% for Overtime AMM)
