| TIP-155 |Stop SB fee burning and redirect to Thales Stakers | Draft | fhd | Stop SB fee burning and redirect to Thales Stakers|  | 2022-07-11
 
## Simple Summary
 Collected SB fees are to be distributed to Thales Stakers in a similar fashion to regular staking rewards. SB fees are to be claimable weekly, and if unclaimed go back into the pool for next week's rewards, split among all stakers for the next week.
 
 These distributions will be similar to allowances: each chain is seperate, SafeBox fees on Arbitrum are to be distributed to those staking Thales on Arbitrum. This solution is by no means perfect -- but cross-chain **anything** is not quite there yet. This can be changed in the future to distribute fees irrespective of which chain someone stakes their Thales on. But, for the time being, we can expect that it will only take users a few weeks to balance both chains so that fees per Thales staked are similar.

 
 This will be instead of buying back and burning Thales, as the only way to realize the benefits of BBB is through selling Thales or being an LP.
## Motivation
Stakers will directly benefit, on a weekly basis, from USD-based payouts. I am hoping that this starts the shift to ungating all of the AMM's and removing the need for Thales Stakers to provide liquidity in order to get value from their position.
