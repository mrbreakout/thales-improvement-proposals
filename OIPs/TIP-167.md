## Simple Summary

 This TIP proposes a 10 weeks Aerodrome bribes program with 200k THALES total amount and a POL position of $200k in the THALES-USDbC pool

## Abstract

As Aerodrome launched on Base network, it provides an opportunity to leverage our partnering relationship with Aerodrome team with a bribes program and a POL boost. This should boost and compliment the THALES token launch on Base.
  
This TIP proposes to commence a **10 weeks program for bribing THALES-USDC and THALES-ETH Aerodrome pools with 10,000 THALES each for 10 weeks** and it additionally proposes to **seed a protocol owned liquidity position of $200k in the THALES-USDbC pool on Aerodrome**.
  
 ## Motivation
 
Aerodrome has a great opportunity to capture the role of a liquidity sink and a leading DEX on Base network. As a launch partner, Thales also has the opportunity to leverage this position by promoting and rewarding voters for THALES pools and thus inviting additional liquidity in the Base ecosystem.      
  
To further align, this TIP proposes for the Thales Treasury DAO to provide $200k liquidity in the THALES-USDbC pool on Aerodrome to accrue additional AERO tokens, boost the pool TVL and overall support the ecosystem.

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Treasury DAO to bribe the following Aerodrome pools for 10 weeks:

- `vAMM-WETH/THALES` 10,000 THALES per week
- `vAMM-USDbC/THALES` 10,000 THALES per week

This TIP additionally entails the Thales Treasury DAO the following liquidity in the `vAMM-USDbC/THALES` Aerodrome pool:  
  
- 100,000 USDbC + matching THALES tokens (at time of writing ~ 260,000 THALES)
