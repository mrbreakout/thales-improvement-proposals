## Simple Summary

Decrease LP Incentives on Optimism

## Abstract

This TIP proposes to extend THALES/ETH LP rewards on Optimism with the following reduced weekly emissions:

- Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 2,500 OP + 24,000 THALES per week
- Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week
- Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week
  
These emissions are to run **until further revaluation** by the Thales Governance Structure.  
  
## Motivation
 
Slight decrease in LP rewards for THALES pairs on Optimism should be healthy in regards to inflation, while other non-inflationary methods are considered and worked on as a longer term liquidity depth solution.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Arrakis   Thales/WETH rewards -   2,500 OP + 24,000 Thales  per week
- Velodrome Thales/WETH bribes -   6,000 Thales per week + 50% veVELO NFT vote  
- Velodrome Thales/USDC bribes -   6,000 Thales per week + 50% veVELO NFT vote  
  
Bribes collected through voting in Velodrome are to be compounded into both pools weekly along with the claim of the veVelo rebase.  
  
The incentives in this proposal are to be valid **until further revaluation** from implementation.
