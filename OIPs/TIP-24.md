| TIP-24 | Move Thales Council NFT from Orilla to ramblers99  | Implemented | padzank (@padzank)| Replace Orilla from Thales Council with ramblers99, who is next in line by election votes, by removing TC NFT from Orilla and sending it to ramblers99 | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-01-25
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to adhere to wishes of council member Orilla, and replace him from Thales Council with ramblers99, who is next in line by election votes.
 
## Abstract
 
With Orilla deciding to step down from the position of Thales Council member, there needs to be an unanimous vote from the remaining Thales Council members to remove the TC NFT from him and send it to ramblers99, that is chosen as his replacement to take on his role of Thales Council member. As a Thales Council nominee that finished in 8th place in the previous elections, ramblers99 is the next in line to inherit the vacant Council position, if unanimously agreed and voted on by the remaining council.
 
## Motivation
 
In the TIP-10, that among other things formalized the second epoch of Thales Council, there was an introduction of new guidelines that outline the process of replacing a council member.
> Duration of 6 months is a relatively long epoch and it is not impossible that, for whatever reason, a council member is not able to tend to his duties. To ensure that the governance is fully operational without a single weak link, the active council members can make a decision that requires an unanimous vote (6 of 6) to replace the inactive member as they see fit.  

> In case of an unanimous vote by the Thales Council to remove an inactive Council Member, this proposal also entails Thales Protocol DAO to remove the Thales Council NFT from the said inactive Council Member and send it to an address of the new Council Member that is chosen as a replacement by the council.  

As the council member Orilla decided to step down from his position, the Thales Council unofficially agreed to replace him with the next nominee in line that is ramblers99. If this proposal gets a unanimous YES vote, this transition would be official and formalized.
 
## Specification
 
 If this TIP gets voted in by unanimous YES vote, it would entail the Thales ProtocolDAO to remove TC-NFT from `orilla.eth` address and send it to `Vote4S.eth` address that ramblers99 is in control of. This would effectively give ramblers99 voting power on TIPs and thus formalize his role as new member of Thales Council.
