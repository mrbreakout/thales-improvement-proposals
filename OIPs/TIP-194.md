## Simple Summary

Additional tapering of incentives and bribes across exsiting incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

Current reward structure is:
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 20,000 THALES + 2,000 OP per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 7,000 THALES per week
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week

New reward structure to be:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 18,500 THALES + 1,000 OP per week (7.5% on THALES & 50% on OP reductions)
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,500 THALES per week (~10% reduction)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week (~30% reduction)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week (no change)

These emissions are to run for **8 weeks** until further revaluation.
  
## Motivation
 
Currently, THALES onchain liquidity is relatively deep and more than sufficient, at over $5m TVL. This includes Protocol Owned Liquidy.
Due to recent $OP price action, we can heavily decrease these rewards on the THALES/WETH Arrakis pool.
Given our THALES/USDC pool was deprecated per [TIP-180](https://github.com/0xsvenska/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-180.md](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-180.md) and our veVELO reallocated towards our THALES/WETH pool, this Velodrome pool is quite efficient lately.
Volume is constantly pretty low on the Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool, we can decrease incentives allocated there.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 18,500 THALES + 1,000 OP per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,500 THALES per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 5,000 THALES per week
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
