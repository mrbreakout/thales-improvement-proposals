| TIP-227 | Replace an inactive council member | Draft | Svenska (@0xsvenska) | Replace an inactive council member | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-09-23


## Simple Summary

Replace a Council member (@cryptolawyer) labeled as inactive as per [TIP-10](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-10.md) after missing 2 consecutive votes and not participating in recent TIPs & governance Discord discussions.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes to replace an inactive council member (@cryptolawyer) who missed 2 consecutive votes ([TIP-225](https://www.thales.io/dao/thalesgov.eth/0x013a266a5bf5357c5d19440e3d2c8704a2dfe2bd54627f2b4a7336ec8a053774) and [TIP-217](https://www.thales.io/dao/thalesgov.eth/0x5f500a9540b881382143fb080901f7ec314912cab6bcff992c0c75a8ebfeaad8)).

Beyond the absence of a vote, I also note a lack of activity from him in the discussion related to the last TIP voted ([TIP-217](https://www.thales.io/dao/thalesgov.eth/0x5f500a9540b881382143fb080901f7ec314912cab6bcff992c0c75a8ebfeaad8)).

I brought this situation up in a governance discussion 3 days earlier, without any reaction or response from him.

## Motivation
 
Taking part in the vote of TIPs is the main duty of elected Thales Council members. Failing to vote, or discuss in TIP related channels, weakens the Council in place and puts the entire DAO at risk.

TIP-225 & TIP-217 were not labelled as meta-governance TIPs so they may have passed even with 6 votes but as we saw at the end of last epoch, meta-governance TIPs can be put to a quick vote and if a Council member misses, it can have serious consequences.

I expect all Council members to fully assume their duties, particularly regarding discussing TIPs and above all participating in the vote.

As per [TIP-10](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-10.md) guidance, should this proposal to replace an inactive Council member pass with an unanimous vote (6 of 6), Thales Protocol DAO will have to remove the Thales Council NFT from the said inactive Council Member and send it to an address of the new Council Member that is chosen as a replacement by the Council.

The Council has full authority to choose the person who shall replace the excluded member. The previous situation identified (via [TIP 24](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-24.md)) proposed choosing the candidate who came next in line by election votes. 
Following this logic, in view of the [last election](https://www.thales.io/dao/thalescouncil.eth/0x6a17a87eed3471e95f8ca04b2034c2601ca56dd6b4cf7e632de56f8f3225a531), this would therefore relate to the candidate who came 8th, i.e. @BigPenny.

## Specification 

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to remove the Thales Council NFT from this inactive Council member and send it to an address of the new Council member that is chosen as a replacement by the Council.

I propose that this new Council Member, should he accept the proposal, should be @BigPenny as per last election results.
