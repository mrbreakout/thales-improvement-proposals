- Market question has to be precise, written in English language and free of any ambiguity
- Market has to be mainstream and verifiable via data sources parameter.
- The list of available positions has to be mutually fully exclusive and capture the full range of potential outcomes
- End of positioning phase has to be before the event actually starts

- Market resolution/question should not be more than 6 months into the future
- No morbid, racist, death related markets or otherwise malicious markets are allowed and will be disputed and slashed
- The market has to be linkable to at least one of the offered tags maintained by Oracle Council
- No duplicated markets should be created. Its ok to create more markets around the same event, but with a different sentiment (different question and/or positions).
