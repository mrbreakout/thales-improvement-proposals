## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to deploy and enable an implementation that allows traders to directly buy into and withdraw from Optimistic Exotic Positional Markets with USDC, USDT and DAI.

## Abstract
 
With the implementation of [TIP-58](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-58.md) and [TIP-74](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-74.md) traders can buy into and withdraw from Thales AMM markets in their stablecoin of choice between sUSD, USDC, USDT and DAI.  
 
This TIP proposes to introduce the same functionality for Optimistic Exotic Positional Markets.
 
## Motivation

[TIP-58](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-58.md) has been proven to be quite popular and with the introduction of [TIP-74](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-74.md) that experience is expanded to the withdrawal of funds. It is desireable to set the barrier for using any Thales protocol enabled proudct as low as possible. With this in mind and based on feedback from market markers the features introduced to Thales AMM via [TIP-58](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-58.md) and [TIP-74](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-74.md) should be implemented for Optimistic Exotic Positional Markets as well.

## Specification
 
This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to apply the funcionality from [TIP-58](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-58.md) and [TIP-74](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-74.md) to Optimistic Exotic Positional Markets.
 
Bonds for market creation, market resolving and disputes must be paid in sUSD and are not part of this functionality.
