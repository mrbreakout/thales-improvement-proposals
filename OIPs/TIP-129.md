| TIP-129 | Parlay Vaults| Draft | Ajla (@hinkypunks) | Introduce Parlay Vaults |  | 2023-02-20
 
## Simple Summary
 Parlay Vaults are an addition to Thales AMM and Overtime vaults, where users can deposit funds that trade with Parlay AMM.  
 
 ## Motivation
 In [TIP-70](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-70.md) we introduced the concept of Thales Vaults and different strategies. This TIP explains the rules of specific Parlay Vault that is creating tickets based on dicounted positions only. 


## Specification  
Parlay vault contract that will be created establishes following: 
- Vault run in rounds, e.g. 1 week or 2 weeks
- Users can deposit for a round prior to the round start  
- All trading that the vault does is permissionless (anyone can call the method to make a trade)  
- A trade can only go through if it meets the generic and specific criteria of the vault itself and if there are enough unutilized funds in the vault  
- Vault trades can only be made on markets that mature prior to the end of the round so that the vault PnL in a round can be calculated correctly at the end of the round
- At any time prior to a new round starting, users that have deposited into existing round can signal that they want to leave the vault. If they don't, their funds are reused in the next round.  
- Vault will have a cap of how much can be deposited into them and a utilization rate variable that controls how much of the funds can be utilized for trading  
- Vault trades can only be made on markets where each underlying position has `skewImpactLimit` discount (only puts discounted positons on a parlay ticket)
- Amount to be paid for each trade should not be greater than `maxTradeRate` % of trading allocation in current round
- Vault cannot make same trade with specific markets on Parlay AMM twice  
- TODO: Add a new variable that controls how many time can the same market be used on a parlay within one round

Parlay Vault will have keeper bot that check if a trade can be made and execute those, but the trading itself is permissionless and can be called by any address. 

Parlay AMM changes: 
- added `safeBoxFeePerAddress` variable which holds safe fee for specific address (otherwise safe box fee is calculated based on `safeBoxFee` variable)
- added `parlayAmmFeePerAddress` variable which holds fee for specific address (otherwise parlay amm fee is calculated based on `parlayAmmFee` variable)


## Variables
	priceLowerLimit - minimum price at which the vault can buy
    priceUpperLimit - maximum price at which the vault can buy
    skewImpactLimit - minimum skew impact/discount at which the vault can buy
    maxAllowedDeposit - maximum amount of sUSD that can be deposited into the vault
    utilizationRate - how much of the funds entering a round can be used to trade
    maxTradeRate - how much can of the funds be spent in one trade
    minDepositAmount - the minimum a user can deposit
    maxAllowedUsers - maximum amount of users in the vault at any point in time
    minTradeAmount - the minimum amount of funds the vault can trade in a single tx (how much will be paid per ticket)
