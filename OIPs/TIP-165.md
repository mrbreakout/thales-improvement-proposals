| TIP-165 | Deploy Thales products on OpBNB chain | Draft | @Danijel | Deploy Thales products on OpBNB chain | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-08-18

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to deploy Thales products on OpBNB chain.

## Motivation
OpBNB chain will be pushed strongly by Binance and we have an opportunity to be one of the first dapps on their mainnet, which would get us notable exposure and potential co-marketing opportunities.  

Due to the Optimism tech stack, there is no technical overhead for this deployment. 

To capture the co-marketing opportunities, it is important to signal the desire to deploy at this point by having a TIP voted in and deploying on OpBNB testnet.

We would first deploy thalesmarket products and then other products as the chain matures and we can gauge the traction we and the chain is getting.

## Specification

Deploy thalesmarket contract on OpBNB chain. 
Staking and token deployments are not part of this TIP.

USDC will be used as collateral.

Binance oracles will be used for price feeds. [link](https://oracle.binance.com/)
