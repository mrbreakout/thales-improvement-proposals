| TIP-156 |Launch Thales Products on Base Chain | Draft | fhd |Launch Thales Products on Base Chain |  | 2022-07-13
 
## Simple Summary
Launch Speed Markets on Base. The main collateral to be used should be USDC. Other products should be deployed later if speed markets prove to be successful and base chain as a whole is growing. Thales token should be bridged to Base as soon as possible. 

## Motivation
Base chain will have many users due to airdrop speculation, as well as just being new overall. Base chain will attract many users if we are well positioned when Base Chain mainnet goes live for the public.

## Specification
This TIP entails that Thales can deploy all its contracts and products on Base chain. THALES token will also be deployed with staking and token LPing/POL to be defined in later TIPs
