| TIP-146 | partnerFee | Draft | cyberduck | Change referral mechanism to "sticky until overridden" | https://discord.gg/8bzFdpGTrp | 2022-06-06
 
## Simple Summary
 
As a protocol, both Thales and Overtime allow for and welcome integration with other protocols and frontends for sustainable and decentralized protocol volume growth. To properly incentivise integrators for driving volume, transaction parameter buyFromAMMWithReferrer is to override any existing referral record.

 ## Motivation

By removing referral stickiness until overridden we can ensure that integration is worthwhile for ecosystem partners. 

## Specification

A transaction that uses `buyFromAMMWithReferrer`parameter is to void and override existing referral record in the `Referral` contract for all existing Thales products that utilise the referral mechanism defined in TIP-54 and TIP-68.
