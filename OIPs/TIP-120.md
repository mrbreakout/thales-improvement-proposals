| TIP-120 | Unify market claim window | Draft | Svenska (@svenskafr) | Unify market claim window for Thales & Overtime markets | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2023-01-10


## Abstract

This TIP proposes to unify the market claim window between Thales & Overtime when a user has a winning option to exercise.
 
## Simple Summary
 
Currently, there is a 24 week (6 months) window for Thales and 30 days for Overtime to claim earnings.

In order to extend the window for Overtime and to have a unified setting for both products (Thales & Overtime), this TIP proposes to set a 12 weeks (~3 months) claim window. 

## Motivation
 
The 30 days claim window to exercise positions on Overtime is quite short, we have already had users report that they have exceeded the claim deadline and therefore theoretically lost their earnings.

On the other hand, the 6 months claim window for Thales markets is pretty long and has the side effect that losing positions remain visible for a long time in a user's token list.

## Specification 

This proposal proposes to set the claim window to 12 weeks for new markets created after the implementation of this TIP.

## Examples  

Alice bought 100 UP positions for a Thales market with a maturation date set on 2022-01-01 and 100 HOME positions for an Overtime game with a maturation date set on 2022-01-15.

Should these markets resolve as a win, she can exercise her winnings until 2022-03-26 on Thales and 2022-04-09 on Overtime.
