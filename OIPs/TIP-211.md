| TIP-211 | Introduce a Post-Cooldown Unstake Window for Thales Staking| Draft | stake_stake |Introduce a Post-Cooldown Unstake Window for Thales Staking | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-05-20


## Simple Summary

Introduce a 2 day unstaking window following the cooldown period for Thales staking.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes a mandatory unstaking window after the cooldown period for Thales staking. Stakers will have 2 days to withdraw their tokens; failing to do so within this window will require them to either re-stake their tokens or initiate another cooldown period. A shorter window of 1 day should also be considered.
## Motivation
Currently, stakers have the option to remain passive after the cooldown period, allowing them to unstake at any moment. This flexibility contributes to a lack of urgency and dminishes the intentionality behind their decisions to unstake. By implementing an unstaking window, we induce a sense of urgency and compel stakers to make deliberate, timely decisions regarding their stake in the protocol. The suggested 2 day window draws inspiration from Aave's staking model (source: AAVE FAQ), but a shorter window of 1 day should also be considered.
## Specification 

Establish a duration for the unstaking window. 

The existing Thales staking contract will require an upgrade to implement and enforce a fixed or adjustable unstaking window. 

Users will be permitted to unstake their tokens only after the cooldown period has elapsed (time t) and during the unstaking window (from t to t + unstaking window duration). Should this window expire (post t + unstaking window), users will only be allowed to either re-stake their tokens or initiate another cooldown period.


## Implementation

To be discussed with engineers upon approval
