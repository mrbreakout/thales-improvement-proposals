| TIP-5 | Title | Implemented | padzank (@padzank) | Create a budget for marketing, product growth and driving THALES liquidity | https://research.thales.io/t/tip-5-budget-for-marketing-product-growth-and-driving-thales-liquidity/43 | 2021-09-28

## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to allocate certain amount of funds from ThalesDAO treasury to be used for marketing purposes, main product growth purposes and for driving THALES governance token liquidity

## Abstract

To secure further developement of the Thales protocol in a transparent manner, this TIP proposes to create a budget of **1,000,000 USDC** and **500,000 THALES** tokens to be used, at Thales Council members and Thales Core Contributors discretion, for expanding marketing, accelerating product growth and driving THALES liquidity **until end of Q2 2022 (end of June 2022)**.

## Motivation

As the developement of Thales protocol is progressing further, it is important to stay aligned with the principles of decentralised governance. Creation of a budget to fund and organize new marketing campaigns, outsourcing certain parts of product developement and seeding THALES token liquidity on more DEX-es, should be discussed with the community and voted on by the community-elected Thales council.

## Specification

This proposal entails the ThalesDAO to reserve:  

- 1,000,000 USDC

- 500,000 THALES

These reserves are to be deployed at Thales Core Contributors discretion *ad hoc* with Thales Council beeing privy in all expenses in detail and holding the right to veto any expense.
