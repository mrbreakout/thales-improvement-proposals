| OIP-249 | Re-enable 0.25% kickback open referral system | Draft | Padzank (@padzank) | Enable permissionless referral for 0.25% of referred volume | https://discord.gg/thales | 2025-07-18

## Simple Summary
Re-enable a permissionless referral system that provides referrers with 0.25% of the volume they drive.

## Abstract

Overtime currently operates a closed referral system, restricted to manually whitelisted Gold Tier partners such as key integrators and high-value ambassadors. While an XP-based referral system is set to launch with Overdrop League Season 2 in August 2025, this OIP proposes reinstating a direct volume kickback public referral program alongside it.

Specifically, this OIP proposes allowing anyone to generate a referral link that provides 0.25% of referred volume as a kickback. This rate is intentionally modest, minimizing the incentive for self-referral abuse, while still meaningful enough to attract motivated affiliates. The Overtime team will monitor affiliate behavior onchain and will promote high-performing participants to Gold Tier status, granting them a 1% kickback and potential additional privileges.

## Motivation

- **Expand affiliate reach:** A permissionless system empowers anyone to become a promoter, driving broader organic growth without requiring team approval.

- **Layered incentives:** While XP rewards will drive Overdrop League engagement, a real-volume kickback incentivizes affiliates with longer-term commercial alignment.

- **Abuse mitigation through design:** A 0.25% rebate is small enough that self-referral yields limited economic benefit, reducing the risk of abuse.

- **Clear path to higher rewards:** While 0.25% alone may not be highly enticing to all users, the ability to be upgraded to a 1% Gold Tier status based on performance is a significant incentive. This creates a strong draw for affiliates to build genuine, high-performing referral networks in hopes of reaching the higher reward tier. The team retains discretion to upgrade successful affiliates, preserving quality while creating aspirational targets for new promoters.

- **Proven growth mechanism:** Referral systems have consistently proven effective in driving user acquisition and retentionâ€”both onchain and offchain. From onchain to Web2 giants, referrals have played a central role in scaling usage and community participation. Enabling this dynamic in a permissionless way on Overtime aligns with battle-tested models that have driven billions in volume across the industry.

## Specification

This OIP entails the Overtime Protocol DAO to enable referral infrastructure that allows any user to generate a unique, trackable referral link tied to their address onchain that allocates a 0.25% kickback of referred trading volume.

## Implementation

TBD
