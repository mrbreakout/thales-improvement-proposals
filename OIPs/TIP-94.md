| TIP-94 | Inclusion of Discount Incentives to pro rata Trading Incentives | Implemented | padzank (@padzank)| Detailed plan around changes towards Trading Incentives so they include purchases of Discounted Position in effort to further balance the AMM  | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-10-04
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes a plan around changes towards Thales marketplace Trading Incentives so they include purchases of Discounted Position in effort to further balance the AMM.
 
## Abstract
 
This TIP proposes to change the OP + THALES Trading Incentives towards traders on Thales in a way they additionally include a fourth bucket (additional to UP, DOWN and Ranged buyers) that will be the rewards for traders who purchase the Discounted Positions and thus award them for further balancing the Thales AMM.
 
  With these changes, the rewards distribution will look like the following (per 14-day rewards round):
  - 9,000 OP + 15,000 THALES pro-rata towards UP token Buyers
  - 9,000 OP + 15,000 THALES towards DOWN token Buyers
  - 5,000 OP + 10,000 THALES towards Ranged Markets IN/OUT tokens Buyers
  - **5,000 OP + 10,000 THALES towards any Discounted Tokens Buyers**
   
   **If voted in, this program is to be implemented for the remainder of final 2 reward rounds (28 days).**

## Motivation
 
 With the newly deployed Discount mechanism, that incentivizes AMM balancing by applying a discount on positions that are oposite of the overbought positions, it is beneficial to additionally reward traders who buy these discounted positions as it increases the AMM balance. This will serve as a promotion of the discount mechanism and it will bootstrap the process of traders familiarizing with the mechanism so they actively start taking advantage of it in mutual benefit with the AMM.
 
## Specification
 
 This TIP entails the Thales Treasury to continue with the designated total Trading Incentives allocation detailed in TIP-56, but with distribution per 14-day round changed to following:  
  
  - 9,000 OP + 15,000 THALES pro-rata towards UP token Buyers
  - 9,000 OP + 15,000 THALES towards DOWN token Buyers
  - 5,000 OP + 10,000 THALES towards Ranged Markets IN/OUT tokens Buyers
  - **5,000 OP + 10,000 THALES towards any Discounted Tokens Buyers**
