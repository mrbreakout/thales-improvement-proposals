| TIP-171 | Partial unstake without requiring full LP withdrawal from AMM | Implemented | @acyberduck | Allow unstaking $Thales as long as Thales/LP ratio is met with the new balance | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-09-20

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to allow partial $Thales unstaking, without requiring the wallet to first withdraw full LP positions from AMMs as long as the required $Thales/sUSD is met with the new balance. 

## Motivation
Currently, Thales staking and AMM LPing is enabled on multiple networks and new networks are being added by governance once in a while. Allocation for providing liquidity in the AMMs is set by the number of $Thales staked on a network. A staker that wants to support a new network, by bridging some of his staked $Thales is currently forced to first withdraw his entire AMM LP position, before he can unstake any amount of $Thales, which can take up to 2 weeks in total, with capital being idle. 

Allowing stakers to unstake a partial amount of $Thales, as long as the $Thales/sUSD ratio is maintained with the new balance would faciliate more efficient capital flow to other networks. 

## Specification
A wallet can signal unstaking an amount of $Thales, up to an amount where the $Thales staked after withdrawal still maintains necessary $Thales/sUSD ratio across the AMMs LPs, including any signalled LP withdrawals.
