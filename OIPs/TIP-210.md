| TIP-210 | Extend Cooldown Period for Thales Staking| Draft | stake_stake | Extend Cooldown Period for Thales Staking | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-05-20


## Simple Summary

Extend the cooldown period for Thales staking from 7 to 20+ days.

## Abstract

This TIP advocates for extending the cooldown period required for unstaking Thales. Currently set at 7 days, we propose increasing this period to 20 days. An extension of the period to 30, 60, or 90 days should also be considered.

## Motivation
The current 7-day cooldown period for unstaking Thales tokens is comparatively short. The suggested increase to a 20-day cooldown draws inspiration from Aaveâ€™s staking model (source: AAVE FAQ). Additionally, we should consider extending this period further to 30, 60, or even 90 days to strengthen long-term commitment and protocol stability.  

## Specification 

Determine a new cooldown period of at least 20 days for unstaking Thales. 

Upon agreement, this extended cooldown duration will be implemented to replace the current 7-day period.

## Implementation

To be discussed with engineers upon approval
