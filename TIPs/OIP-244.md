| OIP-244 | Update Free Bet Logic to One-Time Use | Draft  | @red   | Modify free bet structure so the buy-in is not recycled to user after first use               | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/overtime-io) | 2025-06-03 |

## Simple Summary

This OIP proposes a change to the Free Bets system on Overtime: after a free bet is used, only the net winnings are paid out to the user, while the buy-in amount is returned to the protocol rather than being recycled to the user’s free bet balance.

## Abstract

Currently, when a user places a bet using a free bet (e.g., 10 USDC), if the bet wins, the net winnings (i.e., anything above the 10 USDC) are paid out to the user, and the original free bet amount is returned to their free bet balance for reuse. If the bet loses, the free bet amount is forfeited and sent to the liquidity providers. This proposal changes only the winning case: after a win, only the **net winnings** will be sent to the user’s wallet, and the original free bet value will be returned to the protocol for future user acquisition. Losing bets will continue to behave as they do now — the free bet is forfeited.

## Motivation

The current model allows users to reuse free bets repeatedly, significantly increasing protocol costs. Shifting to a one-time use model:

- Reduces the cumulative cost of each incentive.
- Aligns with industry-standard sportsbook promotions.
- Creates urgency and encourages thoughtful use by recipients.
- Enables more efficient capital rotation for growth.

This change is more sustainable and aligns better with long-term marketing and user acquisition strategy.

## Specification

- The `FreeBetsHolder` contract logic will be updated as follows:
  - If a user **wins** a bet using a free bet, they receive **only the net winnings**, and the original free bet amount is returned to the protocol.
  - If a user **loses** the bet, the free bet amount is forfeited to the protocol (unchanged from current logic).
- This change will apply only to newly issued free bets after the activation date.
- The change will be effective starting **July 8, 2025** (Epoch 12).

## Rationale

- **Sustainability**: Prevents indefinite recycling of incentives, reducing free bet liabilities.
- **Consistency**: Aligns with common sportsbook practices for promotional offers.
- **Efficiency**: Allows the protocol to reallocate unused capital for new users and campaigns.

## Test Cases

Not applicable to this governance proposal, but implementation will be tested in contract updates before deployment.

## Implementation

A small logic update is required in the `FreeBetsHolder.sol` contract to skip re-crediting the buy-in amount after a win. Existing free bet balances will retain current behavior; the change applies only to free bets granted post-upgrade.
