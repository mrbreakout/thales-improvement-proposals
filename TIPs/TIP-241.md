| TIP-241 | Implement an expiry period for Freebets | Draft | Svenska (0xsvenska) | Implement an expiry period for Freebets| [Discord](https://discord.gg/thales) | 2025-02-17

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to implement a 12-week (~3 months) expiration period for freebets distributed in multiple collaterals (THALES/OVER, OP, ARB, etc.) by Overtime, introduced with [TIP-208](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-208.md). 

Currently, freebets do not have a usage deadline, leading to unnecessary capital being locked in proxy contracts indefinitely.

## Motivation
The absence of an expiration period for freebets results in inefficiencies, as unused funds remain idle in proxy contracts. 

Introducing a time limit will:
- Encourage users to engage with the platform actively and use their freebets in a timely manner
- Prevent excessive accumulation of unclaimed funds
- Align freebet rules with the existing claim period for winning tickets (as per [TIP-120](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-120.md))
- Allows unused funds to be reallocated for potential distribution of new freebets to other users

## Specification
Expiration Period: Freebets will expire 12 weeks after being allocated to a user.

After 12 weeks, any unused freebets will be removed from the user's proxy contract and returned to Treasury.

Existing freebets in user proxy contracts will also be subject to the 12-week rule.

## Rationale
Setting a 12-week expiration period aligns freebets with Overtime's existing framework for claiming winning positions. 
This consistency simplifies user experience and expectations while ensuring that freebet funds do not remain idle indefinitely. 
By reclaiming unused freebets, Overtime can reallocate these resources more effectively, potentially issuing new freebets to incentivize other users.

## Implementation
Use current `removeUserFundingBatch` function from https://github.com/thales-markets/contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/FreeBets/FreeBetsHolder.sol
