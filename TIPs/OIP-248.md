| OIP-248 | Speed Markets UX Upgrade and Overtime Integration | Draft  | @danijelgornja | Improve Speed Markets UX and integration by standardizing collateral, enabling free bets, and more.    | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/overtime-io) | 2025-07-17 |

## Simple Summary

This OIP proposes key upgrades to the Speed Markets product suite: switching default collateral to native USDC, adding new native collateral options (including OVER with bonuses), integrating free bets, and enabling shorter timeframes. These changes align Speed Markets with the main Overtime app and incentive programs like Overdrop.

## Abstract

Speed Markets have shown promising user growth and improved performance since the launch of V2. However, they remain partially siloed and use inconsistent collaterals across chains. This OIP unifies default collateral to native USDC, adds bonus incentives for using OVER, introduces more native collateral options like wETH and cbBTC, integrates the Overtime free bet system, and allows the introduction of ultra-fast 1-minute markets (based on pDAO discretion for exact rollout).

The goal is to unify the UX across Overtime products, make Speed Markets eligible for Overdrop and incentive campaigns, and significantly increase user acquisition and retention by making the product more seamless, rewarding, and accessible.

## Motivation

Speed Markets currently:
- Use inconsistent collaterals (USDbC on Base, USDC.e on Arbitrum)
- Lack support for multiple native collateral (ETH or BTC based and $OVER with extra payout)
- Lack free bet support, limiting acquisition funnels
- Miss integration with campaign infrastructure

The proposal brings Speed Markets up to the same integration level as the Overtime sportsbook product. It opens the door for greater usage, supports a broader collateral base, and aligns incentives for onboarding and retention.

## Specification

- **Collateral**
    - Set native USDC as the default collateral across all chains
    - Allow support for multiple native collateral (buyin and payout natively in e.g. ETH)
    - Enable OVER token with bonus payout

- **Free Bets**
    - Integrate free bets into Speed Markets with tracking, eligibility, and redemption mechanics
    - Link to Overdrop and other XP reward programs

- **Shorter Timeframes**
    - Enable shorter trade durations, including 1-minute markets (where supported by chain gas and oracles)
    - Rollout controlled via pDAO parameters 

- **Frontend / UX**
    - Begin integration into core Overtime UI for unified experience
    - Maintain standalone Speed Markets dapp

## Rationale

- **Unification**: Brings Speed Markets inline with the broader Overtime platform.
- **Composability**: Makes Speed Markets compatible with more token types and the DAOs' native token.
- **User Growth**: Free bets and faster trading options will attract new user segments.
- **Campaign Alignment**: Enables Speed Markets to participate in Overdrop and future XP-based systems.
