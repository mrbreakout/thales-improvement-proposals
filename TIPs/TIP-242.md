| TIP-242 | User Ticket Cancelation     | Draft | @danijel | Adds feature to allow users to cancel tickets if all legs are still available to bet on, with cashout calculation and cancellation fee. | https://discord.com/invite/overtime-io | 2025-06-03 |

## Simple Summary

This proposal introduces a new feature enabling users to cancel their tickets under specific conditions. Cancellation is only allowed if all ticket legs remain open for betting (i.e., a fresh quote can be fetched). The system calculates a fair cashout amount capped by the original buy-in and charges a cancellation fee.

## Abstract

The ticket cancellation functionality allows bettors to recover part of their stake if they decide to cancel before any leg settles or becomes unavailable. The refund amount is dynamically calculated based on updated odds, ensuring fairness for both the user and the platform. A cancellation fee equal to twice the SafeBox fee (4%) is applied to cover operational costs.

## Motivation

Users currently have no way to retract a bet once placed, which reduces flexibility and may discourage engagement. Allowing ticket cancellation with a transparent cashout mechanism enhances user experience and aligns incentives by protecting the platform’s risk exposure.

## Specification

- Users may cancel a ticket only if:
  - The ticket is not a system, SGP, or live bet.
  - All legs are still open for betting (validated via a fresh odds quote).
- Cashout calculation:
  - Let `originalExpectedPayout = buyIn / originalTotalQuote`
  - Let `newExpectedPayout = buyIn / newTotalQuote` (fresh quote)
  - If `newExpectedPayout >= originalExpectedPayout`,  
    `refund = (buyIn * originalExpectedPayout) / newExpectedPayout - cancellationFee`
  - Else,  
    `refund = buyIn - cancellationFee`
  - The refund is capped by the original buy-in.
- Cancellation fee = 4% (2x SafeBox fee of 2%).
- Funds are returned from the platform’s liquidity pool.
- Governance will consider imposing a time limit for cancellations (e.g., within 1 hour of purchase).

## Rationale

The refund logic ensures users do not profit unfairly from cancellations while allowing reasonable recovery when odds change favorably or unfavorably. The cancellation fee covers administrative overhead and discourages frivolous cancellations.

## Test Cases

- **Case 1: Odds improve after purchase (better for user)**
  - Buy-in: 10 USDC
  - Original odds implied: 0.666 (approx 1.5x payout)
  - New odds implied: 0.5 (approx 2x payout)
  - `newExpectedPayout < originalExpectedPayout` → refund = buyIn - 4% fee = 9.6 USDC (approx)
  
- **Case 2: Odds worsen after purchase (worse for user)**
  - Buy-in: 10 USDC
  - Original odds implied: 0.5
  - New odds implied: 0.666
  - `newExpectedPayout >= originalExpectedPayout` → refund scaled proportionally  
    `refund = (10 * originalExpectedPayout) / newExpectedPayout - 4% fee` ≈ 7.2 USDC

- Refunds never exceed the original buy-in amount.

## Implementation

- Contract method `cancelTicketByOwner` added.
- Validates user ownership and ticket eligibility.
- Fetches current odds and calculates refund using above formula.
- Applies cancellation fee.
- Transfers refund from liquidity pool to user.
- Emits `TicketResolved` event with cancellation info.
- Includes TODO for governance-controlled cancellation time window.
